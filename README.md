# EXPERIMENT-2

Aim:-
To study and implement lists in Python and perform various operations such as creation of lists, accessing elements, slicing, adding items, removing items, and finding maximum and minimum values.

Theory:-
A list in Python is a collection of items that are ordered, changeable (mutable), and allow duplicate values. Lists can store different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and boolean values. Python provides built-in functions like append(), remove(), max(), and min() to perform operations on lists easily.

Algorithm:-

Start the program.

Create different lists containing various data types.

Display list elements using indexing and slicing.

Add new elements to the list using append() function.

Remove elements from the list using remove() function.

Find the maximum and minimum values in a list using max() and min().

Display the final output.

Stop the program.

Conclusion:-
Thus, the experiment was successfully performed and we studied the concept of lists in Python along with various list operations such as accessing, updating, adding, and removing elements. Lists help in storing and managing multiple values efficiently in Python programs.
