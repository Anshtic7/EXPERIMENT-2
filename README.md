# EXPERIMENT-2

Aim:-
To study and implement lists in Python and perform various operations such as creation of lists, accessing elements, slicing, adding items, removing items, and finding maximum and minimum values.

Theory:-
In this experiment, Python lists are used to store and manipulate collections of data. A list is an ordered, mutable data structure that can hold elements of different data types. Lists are created using square brackets [].
The print() function is used to display list contents.

Elements of a list are accessed using indexing, where positive indices start from 0 and negative indexing starts from -1 from the end. Slicing (list[start:end]) is used to extract a portion of a list.

Lists support modification operations such as assigning a new value to an index, adding elements using append(), inserting elements at a specific position using insert(), and combining two lists using extend().

Built-in functions like max(), min(), and sum() are used to find the maximum value, minimum value, and total of numeric list elements. The sorted() function arranges list elements in ascending order.
Elements can be removed from a list using the remove() method.

Thus, the experiment demonstrates creation, access, modification, traversal, and manipulation of lists using various Python commands.

Algorithm:- 

Start the program.

Create lists using square brackets [].

Display list elements using print().

Access individual elements using indexing (list[index]).

Access elements from the end using negative indexing (list[-index]).

Extract parts of a list using slicing (list[start:end], list[:end], list[start:]).

Modify an element by assigning a new value using list[index] = value.

Add a new element at the end of the list using append().

Insert an element at a specific position using insert(position, value).

Combine two lists using extend().

Find the maximum value in a numeric list using max().

Find the minimum value in a numeric list using min().

Find the total of numeric elements using sum().

Sort the list in ascending order using sorted().

Remove specific elements from the list using remove().

Display the final list using print().

Stop the program.

Conclusion:-
Thus, the experiment was successfully performed and we studied the concept of lists in Python along with various list operations such as accessing, updating, adding, and removing elements. Lists help in storing and managing multiple values efficiently in Python programs.
